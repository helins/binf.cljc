  "Contains [[view]] for creating a view over native memory (as opposed to the JVM heap)
   as well as utilities for handling raw pointers.
  
   The main utility is [[view]] which returns a `DirectByteBuffer`. Allocating native memory
   can lead to performance increase and simplifies things when using tools such as JNI.
  
   Other utilities are related to raw pointers and are DANGEROUS.

   Manipulating raw pointers and managing memory is just as error prone as in native programming.
   Those utilities are for users knowing both what they want and what it implies. Otherwise,
   segfaults are to be expected.
  
   <!> Pointer utilities are still experimental, might change in the future <!>"
