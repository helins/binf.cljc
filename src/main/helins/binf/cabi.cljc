  "<!> Stil very experimental, do not use in production <!> 
  
   Interaction with environments that conforms to a C-like ABI.

   This namespace is mainly about defining C structures in order to pass them or to understand
   them when interacting with native functions. It could be when using JNI on the JVM or when
   calling WebAssembly functions in Clojurescript, for instance.

   This opens the road to interacting with languages like C++ and Rust since they allow for
   defining such C structures and commonly do so in the context of libraries.

   BinF already provides utilities for handling arbitrary data in native memory or in WebAssembly memory.
   For example, on the JVM, `DirectByteBuffer` implements view protocols and is commonly used with JNI.
   Some WebAssembly runtimes such as `Wasmer` use them to represent the memory of a WebAssembly module. In
   JS, WebAssembly memories are buffers from which a view can be built.

   What is missing is knowing how to use a C-like ABI which relies on following some rules. For instance,
   the members of a structure are aligned on specific memory addresses for performance reasons. This namespace
   provides utilities for defining such composite data structures as EDN and computing everything there is to compute
   for following those ABI rules.

   3 definitions are needed for understanding these utilities:

     - An `env` is a map containing information needed for computing those rules such as the alignment being used.
       See [[env]] for creating one.

     - A description map describes either a primitive type (eg. [[u32]]) or a composite data structure (eg. [[struct]]).

     - A description function takes an `env` and produces a description map.

   A description map is plain data containing eveything that is needed for handling this type. For instance,
   a description of a structure contains computed memory offsets of all its data fields.

   This namespace contains ready description functions for primitive types (such as [[f32]]) as well as functions
   for creating description functions for composite ones (such as [[array]] or [[struct]]).
  
   See [[struct]] for a small example and a full one in the `helins.binf.example.cabi` namespace from the repository.
   Source code also clearly shows what is being outputed. While daunting at first, this namespace is actually quite simple."
